# FaceRecognitionProject

This project is an attendance taking system built based on our institution. It is able to recognise students and the id linked to them, 2 conditions which have to be
fullfilled before their attendance is taken. It also comes with a web application that allows students to write in with either text or / and images. 
Lecturers are able to view the taken attendance and the messages that student have sent.

Note: Not everything is done by us. We integrated what was found online to suit our requirements. Credits belongs to ones who created it.
